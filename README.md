## Game Rules ⚔️

- **Player's Objective**: Destroy the centipede by shooting at its segments. Each segment hit destroys part of the centipede.
- **Avoid Collisions**: The centipede's head will move towards the player, so avoid getting hit by it. The game is over if the centipede's head collides with the player.
- **Level Progression**: Each level adds more segments to the centipede, increasing the difficulty. As the centipede gets shorter, it speeds up.
- **Power-ups**: Occasionally, power-ups may appear to assist the player.
